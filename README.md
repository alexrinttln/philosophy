## How to contribute

How to contribute if you are an external collaborator, that is, found this repo randomly or you're particularly invited.

### As outside collaborator

To submit a new post: if you have no write access to this repository then you can just create a new discussion and assign the `Submitted` or `Draft` category depending on your post state.

To delete a post: If you want to delete your post, this is not possible (by GitHub natively), see:

But we've created a GitHub bot that allows you to delete your post by typing `DELETE MY POST` into the comments.

### As maintainer or admin

Since you're a maintainer you've access to [Announcements categories](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-05-18-github-discussions-labels-and-announcements-category-format/), so just add your own post the `Published` category if it's complete or `Draft` if it's still in progress.

To delete posts just click on the right bottom button:
