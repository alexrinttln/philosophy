### How to contribute

In this repository we accept posts from anyone, but only admins can publish posts without review.

See the below sections to see how to contribute as external collaborator or as admin.

### As outside collaborator

You can just create a new discussion and assign the `Submitted` or `Draft` category depending on your post state.

To delete a post: If you want to delete your post, this is not possible (by GitHub natively), see (there's no delete button):

But we've created a GitHub bot that allows you to delete your post by typing `DELETE MY POST` into the comments (not working yet).

### As maintainer or admin

Since you're a maintainer you've access to [Announcements categories](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-05-18-github-discussions-labels-and-announcements-category-format/), so just add your own post the `Published` category if it's complete or `Draft` if it's still in progress.

To delete posts just click on the right bottom button:
