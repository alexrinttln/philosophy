## What is it

This is a Content Management System built on top of GitHub API. To see how it works more broadly take a look at [alexrinttln/github-as-cms](https://github.com/alexrinttln/github-as-cms) repository.

But this repository in specific is the CMS behind my blog that will be soon available at https://alexrintt.io.

If you wanna contribute by posting something, take a look at [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute).

## How to contribute

In this repository we accept posts from anyone, but only admins can publish posts without review.

See the below sections to see how to contribute as external collaborator or as admin.

## As outside collaborator

You can just create a new discussion and assign the `Submitted` or `Draft` category depending on your post state.

To delete a post: If you want to delete your post, this is not possible (by GitHub natively), see (there's no delete button):

But we've created a GitHub bot that allows you to delete your post by typing `DELETE MY POST <Discussion Title>` into the comments (The discussion title provided here must match exactly the discussion title provided when creating it).

If you don't wanna delete, just change the discussion category to `Archived` instead.

## As maintainer or admin

Since you're a maintainer you've access to [Announcements categories](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-05-18-github-discussions-labels-and-announcements-category-format/), so just add your own post the `Published` category if it's complete or `Draft` if it's still in progress.

To delete posts just click on the right bottom button:
